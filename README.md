# Graduate-Classwork
 
This repository contains a collection of coding projects and assignments completed during my graduate Computer Science studies at the University of Central Florida. Each directory corresponds to a specific course, with a detailed description of the contents available inside. Below is an overview of the courses, organized by the semester I took them, and a brief summary of the topics covered.

### Spring 2024
**Operating Systems Design Principles (COP5611)**
This advanced course delves into the design and functionality of modern operating systems. Topics include process management, inter-process communication, high-level concurrent programming, virtual memory systems, and elementary queuing theory. The course also covers operating system security and distributed systems, with case studies to provide real-world context. Coding projects in this course focus on implementing and analyzing OS components like process schedulers, memory management systems, and distributed file systems.
